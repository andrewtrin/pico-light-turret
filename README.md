> A smart pan-tilt turret built with LEGOs and a Raspberry Pi Pico that autonomously finds and tracks the brightest light source in its environment.

This project serves as a foundational exercise in robotics, covering hardware integration, sensor data processing, and autonomous "scan-and-lock" behavior using MicroPython.

## ‚úÖ Features

-   **Autonomous Operation:** Continuously scans its environment to find the brightest light.
-   **Scan-and-Lock Logic:** Performs a full 120-degree sweep to gather data before moving to and pausing on the optimal angle.
-   **Modular Code:** Uses helper functions to translate human-readable angles into hardware-specific commands, making the code clean and reusable.
-   **Built with Common Components:** Uses a Raspberry Pi Pico, standard SG90 servos, and LEGOs for easy replication.

## üíª Software & Operation

### Setup

1.  **MicroPython:** Ensure your Raspberry Pi Pico W has the latest version of MicroPython installed.
2.  **IDE:** This project was developed using the **Thonny IDE**.
3.  **File:** Upload `main.py` to the root directory of your Pico. The Pico will automatically run this script on boot.

### How to Operate

1.  Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to a power source via micro-USB.
2.  The `main.py` script will run automatically.
3.  The turret will begin its "Scan, Find, and Lock" routine.
4.  Use a flashlight to test the tracking. The turret will complete a full back-and-forth sweep and then pause for a few seconds on the angle where it detected the brightest light before starting a new scan.
